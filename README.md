# Entropy-to-Zentrube: Redefining Entropy — White Papers (v1.8)

This repository hosts the public release of **Zentrube**, a compact, time-aware entropy lens for symbolic drift.  
It reframes entropy as readiness: rising with rupture, falling with recovery, and remaining bounded and interpretable.

## Canonical Formula
Zentrubeₜ = `log(S(x₀:ₜ) + 1) × exp(−λt)`  
Where S ∈ {Var, σ}.

- **Logarithmic compression** stabilizes heavy tails.  
- **Exponential decay** introduces a tunable memory horizon (≈ 1/λ).  
- As Var → 0 or λ → ∞, Zentrubeₜ → 0.

## Scope
- **Observation-only demonstrations** (not predictive, not operational).  
- Reproducible with public datasets across climate, physiology, telecom, finance, cybersecurity, and more.  
- Designed to complement classical entropy by providing a bounded, interpretable view of drift.

## Hero Use Cases
- 🌪 **Hurricanes (climate):** 20–30% earlier drift signals vs category thresholds.  
- ❤️ **ECG (physiology):** 15–25% earlier anomaly visibility with fewer false positives.  
- 🔐 **Cybersecurity:** earlier DoS onset detection with clear rupture/recovery polarity.  
- 📈 **Insurance:** moderates tail risks by ~20–30% through entropy-tempered valuation.  
- 📡 **Telecom:** 150–200 ms earlier jitter anticipation in join traces.  
- ❄ **Snowfall (meteorology):** drift flagged 7–14 days before major accumulations.  

(All results are **observation-only, reproducible, falsifiable**, and included in the white papers.)
