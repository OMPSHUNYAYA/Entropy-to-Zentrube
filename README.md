# Zentrube: Entropy Redefined — White Papers (v1.8)

This repository hosts the public release of **Zentrube**, a compact, time-aware entropy lens for symbolic drift.

## White Papers
- [Brief Version (v1.8)](Brief_Zentrube_White%20Paper_v1.8.pdf)  
- [Detailed Version (v1.8)](Zentrube_White%20Paper_v1.8.pdf)  

## Canonical Formula
Zentrubeₜ = log(S(x₀:ₜ) + 1) × exp(−λt)  
Where S ∈ {Var, σ}.

- **Logarithmic compression** stabilizes heavy tails.  
- **Exponential decay** introduces a tunable memory horizon (≈ 1/λ).  
- As Var → 0 or λ → ∞, Zentrubeₜ → 0.

## Scope
- **Observation-only demonstrations** (not predictive, not operational).  
- Reproducible with public datasets across climate, physiology, telecom, finance, cybersecurity, and more.  
- Designed to complement classical entropy by providing a bounded, interpretable view of drift.
